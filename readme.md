# **Exploring Sampling Techniques for Addressing Class Imbalance in Machine Learning**  

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that explores strategies to handle class imbalance in datasets using various sampling techniques. It evaluates the effectiveness of these methods on multiple machine learning models to identify the best practices for mitigating imbalanced data issues.

## **üìå Project Objective**  
The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of different sampling techniques on machine learning model performance and to determine optimal approaches for addressing class imbalance in datasets.

## **üìñ Learning Journey**  
Before implementing the sampling methods, I gained foundational knowledge by experimenting with techniques to balance datasets. This included:  
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**  
- **Tomek Links**  
- Using the **`imblearn` library** tools:  
  - **RandomUnderSampler**  
  - **RandomOverSampler**  

These initial experiments provided a deep understanding of the challenges and solutions related to class imbalance.

## **üîç Sampling Techniques Explored**  
The following methods were implemented and analyzed:  
1. **Oversampling**: Increases the representation of minority classes to balance the dataset.  
2. **Undersampling**: Reduces the majority class to achieve class balance.  
3. **Systematic Sampling**: Selects samples at fixed intervals from the dataset.  
4. **Stratified Sampling**: Maintains the original class proportions in the sample.  
5. **Cluster Sampling**: Samples specific clusters to create balanced datasets.  
6. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Generates balanced datasets by sampling with replacement.

## **üß™ Machine Learning Models Evaluated**  
The sampling techniques were tested on the following models to assess their impact:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## **üîë Key Insights and Findings**  
- **Oversampling** proved highly effective for datasets with significant class imbalance.  
- **Stratified Sampling** consistently maintained class proportions, ensuring reliable results.  
- **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** delivered strong performance across various sampling methods.  
- **Cluster Sampling** showed promise when clusters captured meaningful data patterns.
